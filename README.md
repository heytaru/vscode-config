## My VS Code config

---

Hi Everyone,  
This is my vs code config file with the keybindings.

### How to use it on locally

Clone the repo using the git clone.

```git
git clone https://github.com/heytaru/vscode-config.git
```

Copy the `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` into the vscode config path which is `C:/Users/user_name/AppData/Roaming/Code/Users/`

After this, open the vscode.
